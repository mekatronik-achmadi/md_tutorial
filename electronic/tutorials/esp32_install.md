For now, this entire tutorial intended for Arch Linux and it's derivatives.
For other GNU/Linux distros like Ubuntu will written soon.
For Windows like will need more time.

For ESP32 we can use XTensa-ESP32-Elf-GCC.

To install in Arch Linux, you can use this [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc-bin/)

**Notes:** You need to replace all python2* with python* at same module dependency in PKGBUILD.
