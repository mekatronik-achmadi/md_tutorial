## Introduction

Vim is a very powerful terminal source editor, but much lightweight compared to modern source editor.

It is an extended version of vi with additional features,including syntax highlighting,
a comprehensive help system, native scripting (vimscript),
a visual mode for text selection, comparison of files (vimdiff),
and tools with restricted capabilities such as rview and rvim.

Let's face it, Vim is not for beginner or non-commitment programmers.
It never was and it will never be.
