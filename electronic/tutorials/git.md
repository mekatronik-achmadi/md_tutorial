## Introduction

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files,
usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

## Installation

For Windows, you can download [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
Download the **Windows setup** (not the portable package) then install it (use default setting).
